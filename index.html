                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>I started to learn programming in 2018. I have become more interested in learning of JS, CSS and
                    HTML.
                    I had set myself a new goal that a I want to become a front-end developer.
                    When I have a free time, I try to spend it on my studies. My educational process include watching
                    video, reading book and certainly doing exercise. Essential element is practise.
                    I consider, programmer often face on new chalenge for work. He have to solve new task and your
                    brain in tension. Thus, you should always train your brain and improve your skills.
                    So, I like it. It`s chalenge for me.
